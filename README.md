# agentic-visual-debugger

### You push code. You don't know what you broke. This plugin does.

One command. Every page in your app gets tested, screenshotted, and inspected by AI. Broken layout? Missing data? Error toast hiding in a corner? It catches it. You circle the problem with a pen. The AI fixes it.

**You never write a single test.**

---

## You vs. this plugin

| What you do today | What happens with this plugin |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Write tests for every page | AI generates them from your codebase |
| Tests break every time you refactor | Tests use visible text, not CSS selectors — they adapt |
| Screenshots rot in CI artifacts | AI reads every screenshot and fails on visual errors |
| Bug? Read the test code, figure out what broke | Circle the problem on the screenshot. AI traces it to the source and fixes it. |
| "Did my fix actually work?" | Side-by-side before/after comparison |

## 2 minutes from install to first result

**Step 1** — Install the plugin in [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code):

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add bacoco/agentic-visual-debugger
claude plugin install agentic-visual-debugger
```

Then restart Claude Code so the `/visual-*` commands appear in autocomplete.

**Step 2** — Scan your app:

```
/visual-discover
```

Done. 80-150 tests generated. You wrote nothing.

**Step 3** — Run them:

```
/visual-run
```

Every page screenshotted. Every screenshot inspected. Failures flagged.

## See a bug? Point at it.

`/visual-review` opens a full-screen review page. 3D cards, dark theme, animated grid.

![Review page](docs/review-page.png)

Click any screenshot to open it full-screen. Then:

- **Draw freely** on the image with the freehand pen (`F` key)
- **Draw rectangles** around problem areas (`R` key)
- **Add a note** describing what's wrong (popup after each annotation)
- **Flag "Redo page"** if the whole screen is bad (`D` key) — no annotation needed
- **Just select it** without any annotation — defaults to "improve this UI"
- **Undo** any annotation (`Z` key)
- **Navigate** between screenshots with arrows or keyboard left/right

![Circle the bug](docs/review-annotation.png)

Your annotations persist if you close the page (localStorage, 24h). Updated screenshots after a fix show first with a pulsing "UPDATED" badge.

When a before/after pair exists, toggle between old and new versions. Don't like the fix? Click **Revert** to go back.

Click **"Validate"** — the fix manifest is saved server-side. The page tells you the next step.

## The AI fixes it while you watch

```
/visual-fix
```

For each problem you circled:

1. The AI reads your screenshot and zooms into the region you marked
2. It traces the visual bug to the exact component and line of code
3. It implements the fix
4. It rebuilds the app
5. It re-runs that specific test and captures a new screenshot

The review page regenerates with a **before/after comparison tab**. Old screenshot on the left, new one on the right. You see exactly what changed.

![Before and after](docs/fix-before-after.png)

Still not right? Annotate again. Run `/visual-fix` again. **The loop closes when you stop finding problems.**

---

## After a code change — test only what matters

You don't re-run 112 tests after fixing a button. Just describe what you changed:

```
/visual-run I fixed the sidebar and the upload flow
```

The plugin checks your `git diff`, finds the 3 impacted tests, runs those. 30 seconds, not 40 minutes. No test exists for what you changed? The plugin creates one on the fly.

---

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/visual-discover` | Scan your codebase, generate tests for every route |
| `/visual-run` | Run tests — all, or describe what changed |
| `/visual-review` | Open the visual review page |
| `/visual-fix` | Fix everything you annotated, show before/after |
| `/visual-review-stop` | Stop the review server |

### Review page features

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| Freehand drawing | Pen tool or `F` key |
| Rectangle selection | Box tool or `R` key |
| Undo annotation | Button or `Z` key |
| Flag "redo page" | Button or `D` key |
| Select without annotation | Checkbox — defaults to "improve UI" |
| Before/After comparison | Toggle in lightbox when fix exists |
| Revert to previous version | Revert button in before/after panel |
| Session persistence | Annotations saved in localStorage (24h) |
| Updated screenshots first | Pulsing green badge, sorted to top |
| Stability scoring | Pages fixed 3+ times flagged as "critical" |

## Proven on a real production app

**112 routes. 16 backend services. 6 authentication flows.**

Next.js, React, Vue, Angular — any framework with detectable routes. Handles JWT auth, feature flags, file uploads, multi-step workflows, LLM-generated content, responsive layouts.

This isn't a demo. It runs daily on a real SaaS platform.

---

## How it works under the hood

Tests are YAML manifests that describe what the user sees — not how the DOM is structured:

```yaml
- action: click
  target: "Nouvelle conversation"     # visible text, not .btn-primary-v2
- action: llm-check
  criteria: "The page shows seller, buyer, and notary names"
```

When a CSS class changes, Playwright tests break. These don't — because they never knew about the class.

For the full architecture and design decisions, read the **[Design Spec](docs/design-spec.md)**.
